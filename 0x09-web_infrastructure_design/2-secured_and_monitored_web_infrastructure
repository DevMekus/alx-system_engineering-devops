What are Firewalls for?
A firewall is a security system designed to prevent unauthorized access into or out of a computer network. Firewalls are often used to make sure internet users without access are not able to interface with private networks, or intranets, connected to the internet.

Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
HTTPS encrypts the website visitor's connection and hides cookies, URLs and other types of sensitive metadata. HTTPS ensures that any data transferred between the visitor and the website cannot be tampered with or modified by a hacker. HTTPS ensures that the user accesses the actual website and not a fake version.
